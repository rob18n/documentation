# Import

The file import feature allows you to import pre-existing files into your project. You can use this, for example, if you want to import an existing project or if data loss has occurred and you need to restore the data.

During the import, any existing variables will be overwritten if they are present in the imported file.

## Supported formats:
- `.json`

Additional formats can be added upon request. If you need a specific format, feel free to submit a feature request.
