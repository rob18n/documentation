# Variables

The software provides a range of useful features to make managing your projects and variables easier:

## Search Variables

You can easily search for specific variables, allowing you to quickly find the entries you need.

## Filter variables

Filter by "All", "Empty", and "Full" Variables: The software allows you to filter your variables to show either all variables, only the entries with missing ones, or only the fully completed ones.

## Sorting

Variables can be sorted alphabetically or by creation date, in both ascending and descending order. This helps you stay organized and quickly make changes as needed.

## Add Variables

You can easily add new variables by providing the variable name, a description, and the translations in the project languages.

## Identify missing entries

In the sidebar, each variable has a badge indicating whether all language variables have been filled out. This helps you easily see at a glance which variables still need to be completed.


These features make managing projects and language variables simple and efficient, helping you stay organized and on top of your work.
