# Dashboard

The project dashboard is a central platform that provides users with a comprehensive overview of statistics and data related to a specific project. It offers detailed information about the languages used in the project and allows users to add or remove these languages as needed.

The dashboard is divided into several sections, each displaying specific functions and data. One key section is the Project Overview, which provides a summary of the current project, including the project name and a progress indicator.

Another important part of the dashboard is the Statistics on Languages Used. This section lists the languages utilized in the project and provides detailed information such as the proportion of each language within the project and the amount of content created in each language.

Additionally, there is a Language Management section that enables users to organize the languages used in the project. In this section, users can add new languages to the project or remove languages that are no longer needed. This area is designed to be user-friendly, facilitating easy adjustments and management of languages to enhance the projectâ€™s flexibility.
