# Introduction

The software was developed to make managing language variables simpler and more efficient. With a user-friendly interface, developers can easily add, edit, and organize language variables without having to navigate through complicated code or messy spreadsheets.

By using this software, developers save valuable time and can focus on other important tasks. The optimized workflow reduces manual effort and minimizes errors, making the entire process much more enjoyable.

For hobby projects, the software is completely free. If your project eventually becomes commercial, that’s not a problem – you can easily support the project through GitHub Sponsors. This flexibility ensures that the software can accommodate both small-scale projects and larger endeavors.

## About the software

Although the software is implemented in a somewhat unconventional way, it is still well thought out. It is built on Laravel and Vue.js, providing a robust and flexible foundation with a huge developer community. Additionally, an API can be locally integrated, making the software versatile and adaptable for different use cases.

With simple commands, you can customize your build process so that language files are automatically generated. This makes management easier and saves time, allowing you to make your projects more efficient.

## The naming

Perhaps you’ve already noticed the name. It’s a blend of “i18n”, the abbreviation for internationalization, and “Robin”, the name of my son. This way, the name combines the technical function of the software with something personal to me.

The logo is also based on the name “Robin”, which is the English word for a robin, a small bird with a distinctive red breast.
